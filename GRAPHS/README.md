**Graph algorithms**
1. *BFS/DFS*
2. *Topologcal Sort*

   2.1 DFS is preferred over BFS for topological sort as it is efficient here - *https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25229624/using-bfs-for-topological-sort*

3. *Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)*

   3.1 SCC in an undirected graph - By nature, undirected graph is strongly connected (BFS/DFS can be applied)
   
   3.2 SCC in a directed graph - Use topological sort (DFS), reverse topological order, apply DFS/BFS
   
4. *Applications of BFS/DFS - 2, 3, Bipartite check and 2 coloring problem*
5. *Cycle detection in directed and undirected graphs*
6. *Union find - Union-find, Union by rank/size, path compression*
7. *Minimum Spanning Tree - Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm*
8. *Shortest path - Dijkstra's algorithm*
9. *Diameter of a graph - Longest shortest paths among all pair of vertices*
