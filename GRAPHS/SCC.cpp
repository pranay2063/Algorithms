// SCC (Strongly Connected Components)
// A graph is said to be strongly connected if there exists a path between any pair of vertices
// A connected undirected graph is always strongly connected
// For directed graphs, there can be many SCCs in it
// A directed graph is strongly connected if it has 1 SCC in it

// A DFS based solution has been proposed by Kosaraju which does DFS 2 times
// Time complexity of the approach is O(V+E) asymptotically
